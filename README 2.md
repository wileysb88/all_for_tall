**CONCEPT/PURPOSE:**

The application built is a crowd sourcing service for users who want to share details about their day/night, as well as users who are looking to make plans based on what is going on in their city! Participants can make short lived posts, photos and comments attached to certain locations to share what they are doing. Other users can then search the interactive map to see pins at each location. Whether they are looking for the hottest night club, or a cool dive bar, users can click each location to see what posts have been made that night.

This will be built as a website that will be mobile friendly. Ideally this would be a mobile app but time constraints will not allow it.

**USER STORIES:**

User 1 - Female, 24, Big City Life
User 1 is a young social butterfly. She is on every social media outlet at all times and loves to let the world know what she is doing. She regularly goes on to our app to share where she is and the best pictures of herself to make the entire city know she is always at the hottest spots looking hot herself. She posts as she is partying at each location and will check all the posts at her next destination as she is on her way there.

User 2 - Male, 29, Unmotivated but Ready
User 2 is a bit more of a homebody. He has been binge watching his favorite show all weekend but knows he should get out and hang out with his friends. But he really isn't sure where he should go. He goes on the app to see what is going on nearby so he doesn't have to go across the city to get to where he wants to be. He realizes his favorite bar has a lot of posts and it seems crowded so he wants to find a bar that looks like it is a bit more mellow but still has a decent crowd. He won't be posting any pictures or comments at the location but just wants to be able to see what is going on out there.
